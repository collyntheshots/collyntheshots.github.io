# Projects

| Spring 2021 – Summer 2021 | Full Stack Developer, Senior Design, _Systems Engineering Toolkit – US Army
 React, Express, Node, MongoDB (MERN Stack)_
- Implemented Agile methodologies and Atlassian like tools to develop a database-backed web application to further the systems engineering online training for the US Army
- This application was meant to be reminiscent of other online learning tools such as MasterClass and Pluralsight
- This was a ground up project that went through the entire software development life cycle
- Started with the requirement analysis and case development which I personally worked closely with an industrial engineering team to develop
- Next was the documentation phase where the team put together more than 150 pages of what the project should include: requirements, UI elements, and backend structure
- The summer semester consisted of the build and deployment phases where I was personally in charge of the front end and back end of the module creation system; this is where a creator could create a variety of learning modules to expedite the learning process
- I was tasked with using Docker to containerize and deploy the project
